Here are three APIs for online game things, such as **skins**, **donation** and **players statistics**.  
Also I made a **API gateway** for all APIs and **authentification** API.  

Technologies used: ``EntityFramework``, ``SQLite``, ``Redis caching``, ``Ocelot routing for gateway``, ``Serilog for file logging``, ``JWT``, ``ASP.net core Identity``, ``Swagger``
